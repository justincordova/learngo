## Variable declaration syntax

Declare variables using the `var` keyword:

```go
var width int
var name string
```

## Declaration before use

You must declare a variable before using it.

## Go is strongly typed

Go is a **strongly-typed** language — every variable has a specific type that cannot be changed.

## Valid variable names

**Valid names:** `four`, `myVariable`, `count2`

**Invalid names:**
- `int` (reserved keyword)
- `2computers` (cannot start with a number)
- `one?there` (cannot contain special characters like `?`)

Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
